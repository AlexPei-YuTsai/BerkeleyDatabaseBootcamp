# Alex's BerkeleyDatabaseBootcamp File Repository
This repository contains most, if not all of the content I'm responsible for creating during my time in the **COMPSCI X409.1 Introduction to Databases** Berkeley Extension Class. This document describes what is in the repository and will be updated periodically to reflect new file uploads, changes, and thoughts I may have to offer.

The language used here might be a little crass and straightforward, but really this is my way of staying authentic in a time when ChatGPT can hallucinate truthy garbage for you regardless.

Each link redirects you to a repository on a different Module of the course and should contain the notes, assignments, and projects I've created while studying that section. I've also included notes and extra tidbits of information from the **SQL and NoSQL Databases 2nd Edition** textbook I [legally acquired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Library) if I believe that the content consumed there would also be useful.
